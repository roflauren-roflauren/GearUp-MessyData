    "Typically, when presented with two separate methods, classes, or ideology, we've considered the merits and drawbacks of employing either to help develop criteria for using each one. However, unlike a division like data gap filling versus data gap omission, exogenous and endogenous fill methods are not inherently incompatible. \n",

Then, in your own research, you can evaluate which sub-issues or problems will give rise to greater inaccuracy, less tractability, etc. to help you make this decision. Let's get started! "

    "Though I could (and happily would!) talk about the potential downstream effects of re-sampling methods, our key takeaway is this: \n",

And there are no easy ways to know whether and how what you're doing in the data processing stage will meaningfully impact your analysis. The best advice I can offer you is to: (1) prioritize logical soundness and consistency; and (2) just try things out! Data is meant to be explored. \n",
