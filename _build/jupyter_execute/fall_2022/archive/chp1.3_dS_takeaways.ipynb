    "1. When identifying a dataset to work with, remember that usability is not the only criterion of interest — always traceback each resource's original author and verify that author's credibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Always consider the incentives and intended purpose of the work through which data is acquired; doing so can help you identify a reliable data resource more quickly, while also foreshadowing implications for the data itself (and your research should you use it).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Be sure to identify and evaluate the data generation approach used to create an external data resource — especially for figures/metrics where multiple data resources are available. When possible and valuable, consider replicating the data generation process to fortify your usage of the data resource. "
