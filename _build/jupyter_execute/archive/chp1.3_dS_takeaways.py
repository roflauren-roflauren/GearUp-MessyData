# ## Chapter 1.3. - ***Data Sourcing Takeaways***
# 
# 1. When identifying a dataset to work with, remember that usability is not the only criterion of interest — always traceback each resource's original author and verify that author's credibility. 
# 
# 2. Always consider the incentives and intended purpose of the work through which data is acquired; doing so can help you identify a reliable data resource more quickly, while also foreshadowing implications for the data itself (and your research should you use it).
# 
# 3. Be sure to identify and evaluate the data generation approach used to create an external data resource — especially for figures/metrics where multiple data resources are available. When possible and valuable, consider replicating the data generation process to fortify your usage of the data resource.
