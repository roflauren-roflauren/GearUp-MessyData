# Welcome to the Understanding Messy Time Series Data workshop!

This is the Jupyter Book for the Understanding Messy Time Series Data workshop, part of the [Fall 2022 Gear-Up for Science Data initiative.](https://library.stanford.edu/blogs/stanford-libraries-blog/2022/09/fall-2022-gear-science-data)

## Event Details

Time & date: Wednesday, October 12th @ 1-3 PM PST.

Register here: [https://events-legacy.stanford.edu/events/945/94519/](https://events-legacy.stanford.edu/events/945/94519/)

The goals of this workshop are to: 
1. *Identify* and *understand* the key attributes of datasets and the role each one plays in influencing data sourcing decisions. 
2. *Systematize* data (dis)continuity regimes, and *explore* how data-level decisions can impact downstream analysis. 
3. *Contextualize* the construction of data timeliness in data sourcing and data continuity best practices. 
4. *Learn* generalizable paradigms to improve code runtime when applying data best practices in the context of large datasets.
