    "From this quick exploration and visualization exercise, we can see that the FRED data is a timeseries dataset which appears relatively clean and ready for analysis - it contains only two columns: ```DATE``` and ```GDP```. You might be tempted to just go ahead and run with it. But, for official and/or frequently-used statistics in particular, it's worth taking a step back from usability during the data sourcing process. Why? \n",

    "1. Individuals and groups may publish their own versions of statistics which are usable, but perhaps not official. Using the official source can establish credibility for your research. \n",

    "\n",
    "    * e.g., the FRED data (found [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP)) is notated as 'GDP, Billions of Dollars, Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate'. Maybe this adjustment isn't desirable for your research. <br></br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. Particular fields or subjects may have reputable and established datasets that not only can make your research more credible but also easier through the use of existing analytic tools and techniques others have developed for similar research! \n",
    "\n",
    "Point 1 (i.e., using official/licensed data authors for choice statistics) is especially key for social science research (where less direct experimentation and independent data collection may be performed). For US GDP data, a quick web query of *\"Who measures US GDP?\"* informs us that the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is responsible for its publication while the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects the raw data used for GDP calculation ([source 1](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031715/how-does-united-states-government-measure-economic-growth.asp#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20government%20collects%20and,GDP%20and%20the%20national%20income.), [source 2](https://www.commerce.gov/data-and-reports/economic-indicators)).
