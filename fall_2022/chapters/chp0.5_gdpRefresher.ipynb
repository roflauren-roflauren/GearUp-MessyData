    "For the rest of this workshop, we'll be exploring topics in the context of US GDP (**G**ross **D**omestic **P**roduct) data. In case you haven't worked with GDP data before, or you just want a quick refresher, here's a rundown:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* *Definition:* GDP is \"the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period. \n",
    " \n",
    "* *Use:* general indicator of a country's overall productivity and/or economic health (useful for large-scale social inquiries)\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Common forms:* \n",
    "  * nominal GDP - GDP as measured with contemporaneous prices of goods\n",
    " \n",
    "  * real GDP - GDP as measured with a fixed year's prices of goods\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * potential GDP - an estimate of a country's GDP under ideal economic conditions (e.g., steady currency value, low inflation, full employment)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * GDP per capita - GDP divided by the population of a country, productivity per person\n"

    "  * Typically presented as **timeseries** data, a common data type for longitudinal studies. \n",

    "  * Usually published with a **lag** - e.g., 2013 Q2 GDP data wasn't officially released until the end of 2013 Q3.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Computed and posted by **numerous** agencies and entities, typically government-related.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Multiple** approaches available for calculation (e.g., expenditure, production, and income approaches)\n",
    "\n",
