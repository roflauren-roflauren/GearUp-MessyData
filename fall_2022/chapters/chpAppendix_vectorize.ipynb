    "\n",
    "Modern personal machines and shared computing resources (like Stanford's [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/)) are ridiculously powerful, and they can quickly chew through almost any code that you write - even if it has zero optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what happens if you're dealing with truly massive datasets with hundreds of thousands of rows? With such datasets, code runtime can actually become a constraint on research progression and completion if processing scripts are written suboptimally.\n",

    "In computer science, vectorization is a technique related to the mathematical definition of a vector - it's the process of converting an algorithm from a scalar implementation (which performs operations on, at most, a pair of operands at once) to a vectorized one (which performs operations on a series of values at once). For a quick example: \n",
    "\n",
    "The processing of a scalar implementation of the instruction, \"add two to every element in this list,\" would look like: \n",

    "* Framework 1 (which I call the \"built-in's implementation\") is what we saw in the previous coding exercise. It consists of passing vectorized *inputs* to functions which can already handle such inputs as the program in question will utilize package built-in operations designed to process arrays as inputs (i.e., the operators are *overloaded* - having multiple definitions to accord with multiple types of inputs). \n",
    "\n",
    "* Framework 2 (which I call the \"custom implementation\") is what you may have to do more frequently as the functionality you are seeking to vectorize becomes more complex. In these situations, you will have to write your own functions which accept array inputs and process them by creatively using built-in (but not overloaded) functions offered by packages like NumPy or writing your own efficient operation functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Framework 2 is almost always going to be more unwiedly and time-consuming, but it may become unavoidable as your processing becomes more sophisticated and your data diverges from purely numerics. Still, I would always try to make Framework 1 work first - vectorization is a well-developed practice and you'll likely be able to find some resource online seeking to accomplish the same generic task as you.

    "\n",
    "Before diving into the data processing stage of your project, please remember - vectorization is a wonderful and powerful tool, but every tool has its time and place. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you try to vectorize any functionality, ask yourself *\"does this really need to be vectorized?\"* If it doesn't, you could waste more time trying to create an optimized implementation than if you just ran a slightly slower for-loop in the first place! \n",
    "\n",
    "But if you are going to vectorize, here's a (slightly modified) concise approach offered by Sofia Heisler in her [Pycon 2017 address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN5d490_KKk):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Avoid loops, if called for and if you can. \n",
    "2. If you must loop, use ```.apply()``` or a list comprehension, not iteration functions. \n",
    "3. If you must ```.apply()``` or write a list comprehension, use Cython to make it faster. \n",
    "4. Vectorization is usually better than scalar operations. \n",
    "5. Vector operations on NumPy's ```ndarray```s are more efficient than on native Pandas Series. \n",
    "\n",
